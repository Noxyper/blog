Hey, so Delivery Demolition is back up!

I've been working on this project on-and-off for the past couple of months and I am happy to say that the game no longer feels "game jam"-y and now feels more like a proper game. It is still ways off until completion, but many of the complaints in the prior version of the game has been ironed out. There are unfortunately no new levels in this version, but that's due to the next announcement.

This game is getting a real launch a few months from now!

It is still unclear when this will be, but there will be a full version of the game with currently planned for 60 levels, revamped graphics, more story and more mechanics! I will post more about the game on my Twitter ([@NaomiWiren][twitter]) in the coming months, and major updates will show up here. However, as I am in university at the moment and due to the on-going pandemic, this will stay as a hobby project and Delivery Demolition is not going to be my main focus for most of my time.

It's great to work on this project again, and I hope you will enjoy it.
