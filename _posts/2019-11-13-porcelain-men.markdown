Men are made off porcelain. It is what no one wants to admit, what no one wants to know, what no one wants to mention. Spiritually, they're easy to break, but tap the coating lightly and the most unexpected may be proven. My neighbour, when tapped, restarted his life in the mountains. My friend, when tapped, became the most beautiful of women. My brother, when tapped, understood why his life had been so terrible and lived happier than a sunflower in May. But tapping should be taken lightly. My father was tapped, tapped, tapped, and on his fourth tap the blow was too hard. Spritually broken, he backed into a corner, hoped the days would come to an end. The porcelain coating cannot be repaired, and thus he was stuck, mentally broken because of our nosey nature. Women might also be made of porcelain, but I have yet to find out. They say it takes one to know one, and maybe that would be my friend. Until that day comes, I'll carefully test my own porcelain skin, and the day I notice a crack on my wrist, a hole by my hips, or a discolouration on my lips, I will need help to break the shell entirely. I do not know what might lead to my breaking, maybe I'll retrace the steps of my brother, maybe the steps of my neighbour, or the steps of my friend. Maybe it is impossible to know before hand, maybe it is a poorly worded sentence, maybe it is the aching where it best applies. I hope it is not the last one, because how would I know if my entire body is aching?
